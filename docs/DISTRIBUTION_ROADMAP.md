# Distribution Roadmap

## Public Adoption Pipeline
1. Landing page with live demo and benchmarks
2. Public playground (free tier)
3. SDK Python + SDK JS
4. CLI for batch trace and risk evaluation
5. Community edition + enterprise edition packaging

## Why this matters
Without distribution, technically strong projects fail to gain real-world adoption.
